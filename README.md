u-wave resonator

Explanation of files:
functions.py - just some functions I wrote to help with layout (mostly region subtraction, etc. to make the CPW geometry)   

project_layout_final.py - the finalized layout code   

project_sim_layout.py - code to isolate the cavity in the layout and center it (hoped it would help with Meep to no avail)   

sim_test/simulation.py - attempts at Meep (not very well developed, I think it became clear early on Meep would not work)   

project.gds - finalized GDSII file of layout   

sim.gds - GDSII file I hoped to simulate (cavity alone)
